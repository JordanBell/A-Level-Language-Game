A-Level-Language-Game
=====================

Old file versions (local 'commits', before I used Git) of my A-Level Computing software development project, where we created software for a client in order to practically introduce us to the Software Development Life Cycle and various software engineering methods.

These commits are all done retrospectively, and have been dated accordingly.

*Note:* The two earliest commits are incorrectly dated as March, where they should be February.
